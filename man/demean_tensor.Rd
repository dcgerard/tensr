\title{Demeans array data.}
\usage{
demean_tensor(X, mode_reps = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An array, one of whose modes is assumed to be samples from the array
normal model.}

\item{mode_reps}{The mode that contains the samples, or repetitions, from the
array normal model.}
}
\value{
\code{Y} An array that has the same dimensions as \code{X} except
  that the mode \code{mode_reps} has dimension one smaller. This array is
  mean 0 array normal with the same covariance structure as \code{X}.

  \code{X_bar} The sample mean of \code{X}. Under the array normal model,
  \code{X} and \code{Y} are statistically independent.
}
\description{
Rotates an array into two parts, one of which has mean zero.
}
\details{
If one mode contains samples (or repetitions), then this function will rotate
the array into two parts, a mean part and a covariance part. The 'covariance
part' has mean zero and the rest of the methods in this package apply. The
'mean part' is simply the sample mean. If the data are array normal, then the
'covariance part' will also be array normal with the \emph{exact} same
covariance structure as the original tensor, except that there are one fewer
samples.
