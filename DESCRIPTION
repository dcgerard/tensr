Description: This package provides a collection of functions for Kronecker
    structured covariance estimation and testing under the array normal model.
    For estimation, maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant estimation
    procedures are implemented. For testing, a likelihood ratio testing
    procedure is available. This package also contains additional functions
    for manipulating and decomposing tensor data sets.
