Description: A collection of functions for Kronecker structured covariance
    estimation and testing under the array normal model. For estimation,
    maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant estimation procedures are
    implemented. For testing, a likelihood ratio testing procedure is
    available. This package also contains additional functions for manipulating
    and decomposing tensor data sets. This work was partially supported by NSF
    grant DMS-1505136. Details of the methods are described in
    Gerard and Hoff (2015) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.01.020> and
    Gerard and Hoff (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.laa.2016.04.033>.
