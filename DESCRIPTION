Description: A collection of functions for Kronecker structured covariance
    estimation and testing under the array normal model. For estimation,
    maximum likelihood and Bayesian equivariant estimation procedures are
    implemented. For testing, a likelihood ratio testing procedure is
    available. This package also contains additional functions for manipulating
    and decomposing tensor data sets. This work was partially supported by NSF
    grant DMS-1505136.
